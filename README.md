In this project, we take a look at the Social Vulnerability index for Houston and how it relates to national data.  

The social vulnerability index is made of 15 different factors with 4 categories including Socioeconomic Status, Household Composition & Disability, Minority Status & Language, Housing Type & Transportation.

We chart these various metrics using GeoJSON data combined with census data and show them using an HTML and JavaScript front end.
